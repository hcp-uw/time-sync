# TimeSync

## Problem
Finding common times for a meeting is tough!  
Whether you are scheduling a lunch with friends or work time with your colleagues, you never know other peopleâ€™s schedule and oftentimes have to spend hours communicating to find a time when you are all free.  
There is no way that you both can find a convenient time without discussing several options and then slowly coming to a conclusion.

## Solution
We developed a web application for groups of roommates, classmates, and colleagues to sync calendars.  
The model design is based on Kahoot for ease of use for new consumers, utilizing a group numbering system to form groups.

## MVP/Accomplishments
- Built frontend using React and utilized Firebase as the backend to store calendar events and times pulled using Google Calendar API.
- Learned to host the finished project on a live website using Vercel.
